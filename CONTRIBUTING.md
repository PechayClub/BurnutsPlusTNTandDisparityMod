## CLA

Before we can use your code via Pull Request, you need to sign the [(Burnuts CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/Team-Burnuts/BurnutsPlusTNTandDisparityMod), which you can do online.
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution 
becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure 
of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. 
You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and we approved it, but you must do it before  we can put your code into our codebase.
