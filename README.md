## TNT and Disparity Mod

Adventure with Burnuts.

## Notes:

Comments are now allowed in our Curseforge project.

If Forge 1.17 comes out we will start porting our mod to 1.17 after Twilight Forest and the other mods are ported to 1.17.

We moved our repository from Pechayland to Team-Burnuts in github so Azar2477 will delete the old repository.
