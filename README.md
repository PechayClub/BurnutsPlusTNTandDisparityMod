## TNT and Disparity Mod

Adventure with Burnuts.

## Notes

Comments are now allowed in our Curseforge project.

Forge 1.17.1 is now out and were waiting for the following mods to be ported before we port TNT and Disparity to 1.17.1.

We will start to change the license to GNU LGPL 2.1 for the Twilight Forest Integration after adding the Carminite Bases to the mod. AKA Alpha 0.4.1 Integration Test.

You noticed that we changed our logo. Go to this video for a announcement from News and Tips Shower. Video: https://youtu.be/a07i4ft1860

The mod is now republished back in MCreator. Download Link: https://mcreator.net/modification/76770/tnt-and-disparity

Note: Wanna use DJVI's music? Go to his YouTube Channel, his videos has download links and not all are free to download sometimes without copyright (Even if it's under free download you still need to credit him): https://www.youtube.com/user/DJVITechno

Note: We now have a official YouTube Channel for TNT and Disparity. Link is here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDqFoP1kjmFA_-qmCvQ8C9g

We added support for update.json so you will be able to update TNT and Disparity
