## Notes

Comments are now allowed in our Curseforge project.

Forge 1.17.1 is now out and were waiting for the following mods to be ported before we port TNT and Disparity to 1.17.1.

We will start to change the license to GNU LGPL 2.1 for the Twilight Forest Integration after adding the Carminite Bases to the mod. AKA Alpha 0.4.1 Integration Test.

You noticed that we changed our logo. Go to this video for a announcement from News and Tips Shower. Video: https://youtu.be/a07i4ft1860

The mod is now republished back in MCreator. Download Link: https://mcreator.net/modification/76770/tnt-and-disparity

## CLA

Before we can use your code via Pull Request, you need to sign our CLA [(Burnuts CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/Team-Burnuts/BurnutsPlusTNTandDisparityMod), which you can do online.
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution 
becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure 
of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. 
You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and we approved it, but you must do it before
 we can put your code into our codebase.
