Data is self-modified because the data from MCreator is not accurate.

## Legacy MCP Minecraft Versions

These are the Minecraft Versions (1.12 and Below) that use old MCP.

However we don't support these Minecraft Versions anymore, but there is old MCP for Minecraft 1.14 and 1.15 also if you wan't to use them.

We also don't support third-party/unoffical maintaining, but you can fork this repository and fix it yourself. (You are not allowed to make pull request to fix issues for unsupported versions.)
